leetcode 11. Container With Most Water
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        
        int maxA=0,l=0,r=height.length-1;
        int minH,area;
        while(l<r)
        {
            minH=Math.min(height[l],height[r]);
            area=minH*(r-l);
            maxA=Math.max(maxA,area);
            if(height[l]<height[r])
                l++;
            else
                r--;
        }
    return maxA;
    }
}

//here two pointers are taken as left and right , using math function then the minimum of two is found as if we choose max then water will spill out,
after that the distance between these 2 is calculated , then the area inclosed by this is calculated ; which is compared with other area for finding max area.
we shift the pointer in order to get max area.
